    <h1>Guide to trialwise fMRI analysis</h1>
    <p> 
        This website provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and running trialwise analyses with least squares all (LSA) GLM. This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of what LSA is. 
        If this is a completely new concept to you, you should begin your journey by doing some reading (I link some papers and pages below).

    <h2>Note on LSS vs LSA</h2>
    <p> 
        As you read the literature, you may come across a similar approach called the Least squares separate (LSS). 
        <a href="https://nibetaseries.readthedocs.io/en/stable/betaseries.html">This page here</a> provides a conceptual background on both methods, and it explains why some groups prefer the LSS over the LSA
        (but read the Abdulrahman et al. paper below to learn why the story is not actually that straightforward...). If you do end up having to run the LSS instead of the LSA, the steps are almost indentical. 
        All you would have to do is to create a separate onset file for each trial and run the same GLM for each file. Everything else in your analysis approach stays the same.
