    <h1>Creating Mat files and organizing your data</h1>
    <p>
        Mat files are a great way of organizing your trialwise data. They allow you to maintain the paths to all your LSA beta files while storing all pertinent trial information. The file can store whatever you want! 
        This can be trial responses at encoding or retrieval, RTs, event types, memory bins, etc. <br><br>
        You may want to start off with a simple spreadsheet. For example, say you are working with encoding data, 
        and you want your mat file to store paths to your betas, trial category, subcategory, scanner run (important for PSA!), encoding responses, the subsequent memory bin, 
        and an index for the trial during memory test 
        (this index allows you to efficiently load the corresponding beta from the test phase for a pattern similarity analysis, assuming you scanned both phases).<br><br>
        You would end up with something like this! 
        An example of a clean mat file for a single subject is <a href="https://github.com/SabinaSrokova/SabinaSrokova.github.io/blob/main/examples/fmri99_y22_study_data_cleancopy.mat">here.</a>

    <p>
        The way you set this up is entirely up to you. You can work with your behavioral data and create a pipeline in excel if you wish. I, of course, like to write scripts. 
        These are largely experiment-specific, and the way they are set up will vary. So, if automating these in matlab is not your cup of tea, excel is definitely an option. 
        <br><br>
        Note that if you do end up creating your initial mat file in excel, you will need to make sure to save each column of the spreadsheet as a structure variable belonging to a larger structure. 
        If you're not familiar with MATLAB terminology, this may sound like gibberish. In simple terms, I use a function struct() to create a variable called "study_data". 
        Then, I create a sub-structure of this structure, say "study_data.beta_file". The structure beta_file is a character variable, and it has N amount of fiels (N = number of trials). 
        Once you have defined the study_data variable, you can create beta_file and assign the first field (trial 1) simply by typing study_data(1).beta_file = "path_to_file_here". 
        Anytime you are trying to call information specific to Trial X, you index it using study_data(X). Want to find out what the subject's response was on trial 85? Type in study_data(85).vivid_resp.
        <br><br>
        Another thing to bear in mind: For my scripts to work correctly with your mat files, you must ensure you follow the same variable class for each of your structures as I do. 
        Look at the icons in the column headers in the screenshot below. The "ch" icon tells you it's a character variable. The 4 squares are class "double". The fork means the variable is yet another structure.
        <br><br>

        Example of a mat file that has undergone some analyses already... 
        You can download an example file <a href="https://github.com/SabinaSrokova/SabinaSrokova.github.io/blob/main/examples/fmri99_y22_study_data.mat">here</a>

        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SabinaSrokova/SabinaSrokova.github.io/main/examples/matfile_example.PNG" alt="SPM output" class="responsive-image">

        <br><br>

        As you can see above, your mat file can store your extracted voxel-wise and mean betas, or even your PSA correlations. 
        It is what makes mat files way more powerful than standard spreadsheets - You can store the parameters for every individual voxel of all your ROIs within a single cell! <br>
        (Load the file linked above into MATLAB and click on any of the "1x1 struct" cells under extracted_data for a visual demonstration.)
        <br>
        This set up will allow you to run your analyses very efficiently!

        <br><br>
        Lastly, below is an example of a matlab script which creates a clean mat file (akin to the one illustrated above). It is tailored to my CSV spreadsheets generated by psychopy 
        (for context, an example of how I organize my psychopy output is <a href="https://github.com/SabinaSrokova/SabinaSrokova.github.io/blob/main/examples/fmri99_study_y22_1.csv">here</a>).
