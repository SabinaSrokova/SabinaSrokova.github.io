    <h1>Setting up your GLM</h1>
    <p>
        If you know how to run your standard mass-univariate GLM, then this step is going to be a breeze! Here, I assume you have finished preprocessing your data and prepared it for the GLM step. You need the following information: <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Onsets: To be organized in a .mat file in a single vector such that every trial appears in its own column. See example here: XXXX. 
            The duration of your trials (e.g., boxcar or delta) depends on your specific experimental design. SPM also requires column names, these are arbitrary (I do trial_0001 ... trial_N) </li>
        <li>Regressors: Your 6 realignment parameters concatenated into a single session and saved into a .txt file. 
            DO NOT include spike regressors!! The inclusion of spike regressors leads to highly outlying parameter estimates.</li>
        <li>Scans: Preprocessed fMRI data in a .nii format. The fNIM lab has typically used unsmoothed data, however, we have recently made the switch to smoothed data as we dropped to 2 mm isotropic voxels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once you specify your GLM SPM.mat, you will want to apply spm_fmri_concatenate() to model session means. Only then you can estimate your model. This is the same approach as the standard GLM! <br><br>
        I share an example a MATLAB code below. I use settings and subject info files to easily access experiment-specific information in my pipeline. Find an example of a settings file *here*, and an info file *here*.
